This is snakei ("snake eye"), my attempt to write a C library 
buildable with the Android NDK that provides functions to read 
out sensors to Python.

snakei's functions will be defined to use Python.h's type 
definitions, function prototypes, etc. so that we can (eventually)

`import snakei`

in Python and call its functions.
